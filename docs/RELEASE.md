# Releasing Arris

## Cutting a release

1. Set `VERSION` in `src/arris/font.py` (the fonts' version string,
   `head.fontRevision` and the unique ID all follow it).
2. Rebuild everything: `build/scripts/rebuild.sh` (static families, both
   variable fonts with their interpolation check, tests, fontbakery,
   proofs, the specimen's WOFF2s and the presentation).
3. Read `build/scripts/logs/post.log`: pytest passes, fontbakery reports
   no FAIL and no ERROR for the static, variable and Mono sets.
4. Package: `uv run python tools/package.py` writes
   `build/release/Arris-<version>.zip` (static, variable, web, OFL.txt,
   AUTHORS.txt, README.md). It refuses fonts that do not carry the release
   version, the licence URL and installable embedding.
5. Tag the commit `v<version>`; attach the zip to the GitHub release.

## Licence and metadata

SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`OFL.txt`), copyright The Arris Project Authors
(`AUTHORS.txt`); no Reserved Font Name. Every font carries the copyright
(name 0), the licence and its URL (13, 14), embedding installable (fsType
0). The vendor ID is `NONE` (unregistered): register one with Microsoft
before a commercial distribution if wanted.

## 1.000 checklist (2026-10-25)

| Check | State |
|---|---|
| Licence, copyright, version, fsType | done |
| fontbakery `check-universal`, static and Mono families | 0 FAIL, 0 ERROR |
| fontbakery `check-googlefonts` (Regular) | names fixed; West African Latin missing (TODO) |
| Figures against the watch's pixels (pytest) | pass |
| Heavy counters under the squint | main fusions fixed; the rest listed in TODO |
| Mono glyphs inside their cells | yes (upright; the italic leans by its slant) |
| Variable-font interpolation | see the latest `build/vf_check*.json` and TODO |
| Name clash | no other "Arris" typeface on the major stores (a web search, not a trademark search) |
